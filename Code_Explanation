1.Data Loading and Cleaning:
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file.
   - Clean the data by removing any missing values.

2.Estimating Owner Presence Probability:
   - Use logistic regression to estimate the probability of owner presence.

3.k-means Clustering:
   - Apply k-means clustering to segment the data and identify patterns.
   - Visualize the clusters using ggplot2.

4.Feature Engineering:
   - Prepare the data for predictive modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets.

5.Random Forest Model:
   - Train a Random Forest model to predict productivity.
   - Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

6.Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model:
   - Train an SVM model to predict productivity.
   - Evaluate the model using MSE and R-squared metrics.

7. Query Processing Time Reduction:
   - Use the best-performing model to optimize query processing time.

8. Visualization:
   - Visualize the relationship between owner presence probability and productivity.
